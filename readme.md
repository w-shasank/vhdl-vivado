    The next step after diving into the sequential machines is finite state machines .They are mathematical model of computation used to design systems that exists in a limited number of distinct conditions .

    There are mainly two types of fsm:
        1. Moore machine===----->output is function of present state only
        2.Mealy machine===--->output is the function of present state and next state
